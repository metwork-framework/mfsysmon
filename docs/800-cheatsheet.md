## `root` service commands

As `root` unix user:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `service metwork start` | start all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork stop` | stop all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork status` | check all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork start mfsysmon` | start mfsysmon metwork services |
| `service metwork stop mfsysmon` | stop mfsysmon metwork services |
| `service metwork status mfsysmon` | check mfsysmon metwork services |

> Note: if you don't have `service` command on your Linux distribution, you can use `/etc/rc.d/init.d/metwork` instead of `service metwork`. For example: `/etc/rc.d/init.d/metwork start` instead of `service metwork start`. If your Linux distribution uses `systemd`component, you can also start metwork services with classic `systemctl` commands.



## root files or directories

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/metwork.config.d/mfsysmon/config.ini` | override the `mfsysmon` module configuration at system level (note: the first line of this file must be `[INCLUDE_config.ini]`) |
| `/opt/metwork-mfsysmon/config/config.ini` | default `mfsysmon` module configuration (useful to see all configuration options) (**do not edit this file** => use the overriding previous file) |


## "load environment" commands

As a "not metwork" unix user (useless if you are logged as a "mfxxx" unix user as the "metwork environment" is already loaded):

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `source /opt/metwork-mfsysmon/share/interactive_profile` | load the mfsysmon metwork interactive environment |
| `source /opt/metwork-mfsysmon/share/profile` | load the mfsysmon metwork environment (same as above but without fancy stuff about banner, colors and prompt) |
| `/opt/metwork-mfsysmon/bin/mfsysmon_wrapper {YOUR_COMMAND}`| execute the given command in the mfsysmon metwork environment without changing anything to the current environment |

> Note: if you don't have `/opt/metwork-mfsysmon` symbolic link, use `/opt/metwork-mfsysmon-{BRANCH}` instead.

## module commands


As `mfsysmon` user:


| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `mfsysmon.start` | start mfsysmon services |
| `mfsysmon.stop` | stop mfsysmon services |
| `mfsysmon.status` | check mfsysmon services |
| `layers` | list installed layers (loaded layers are prefixed by `(*)`), `layers --help` for more details |
| `layer_load {LAYER_NAME}` | load the given layer (which must be installed), example: `layer_load python3_devtools@mfext` |
| `layer_unload {LAYER_NAME}` | unload the given layer (which must be loaded), example: `layer_unload python3@mfext` |
| `components` | list installed software components (loaded components are prefixed by `(*)`), `components --help` for more details |
| `metwork_debug` | debug the current environment (layers, paths, versions...), useful for debugging or bug reporting |
| `outside {YOUR_COMMAND}`| execute the given command outside the metwork environment without changing anything to the current environment |
